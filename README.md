**Encryption and Decryption Platform**
This project provides a simple web-based platform for encrypting and decrypting messages using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. Users can input a message along with an encryption key to encrypt it, and likewise, they can input an encrypted message along with a decryption key to decrypt it.

**Getting Started**
To use this platform, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

**Usage**
**Encryption**
Enter the message you want to encrypt in the "Enter your message" textarea.
Enter an encryption key in the "Enter encryption key" input field.
Click the "Encrypt" button.
The encrypted message will be displayed in the "Encrypted Message" textarea.

**Decryption**
Paste the encrypted message you want to decrypt in the "Enter encrypted message" textarea.
Enter the decryption key in the "Enter decryption key" input field.
Click the "Decrypt" button.
The decrypted message will be displayed in the "Decrypted Message" textarea.

**Dependencies**
This project uses the CryptoJS library for AES encryption and decryption. The library is included via a CDN link in the HTML file.

**File Structure**
index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the web interface.

style.css: CSS file for styling the interface.

script.js: JavaScript file containing the encryption and decryption functions.

**Contributions**
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
